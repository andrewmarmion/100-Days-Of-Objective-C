# 100 Days of Objective-C

This is a companion repositiory to the [100 Days of Swift](https://github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift), which was created by the fantastic [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws). 

Not everything in this repository will be 100% correct. It is basically a naive implementation of the Swift projects that Paul Hudson provides in his [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) course.
